              I know this is not something a potential employer would want to see. But still lets begin, I want to rant about my procrastination.
              I have an exam tomorrow, yet I haven't started. The total time for me to complete this whole stuff would have been 4 hrs, yet I have delayed indefinitely knowing that I could catch up on extra sleep if I complete early. 
              </p>
              <p>
              My desire to lose body fat is also no motivation to stop eating packaged items. Another bad habit I posess is that I bite my finger nails. I want to stop it altogether. I remember a female friend of mine complementing my nails for they grew long naturally with proper shape before me getting into the habit of biting my nails. Yet I posess no motivation to stop.
              I dont know why I expect my later me to be more motivated and efficient than the current me. This is basis for all procrastination. I know yet I take no action.
              </p>
              <p>
              I have FOMO, watching every new video of the 100's of channels I've subscribed to. Opening Facebook once in ever ten minutes. Opening news.ycombinator every hour and trying to read all the posts even though half of those don't make any sense. And quora, just don't even get me started there. Can I make use of my time more judiciously? Well I have given it a thought and I think the time has come to change my habits for the good. I am so lazy that I have not yet applied for an internship. Whereas my peers have already received their confirmation letters, I want to roam the world, but I have no motivation. I guess I'll never get any motivation and the reason I have been procrastinating for so long is that I was always waiting for some motivation, But I realize that it is never going to come. I just need to do what I want to do, without someone else trying to brainstorm me or motivating me, only then can I get motivation. I guess the only motivation I need is the motivation to complete which will come naturally once I start something. I am looking forward to it, and also i am going to start studying.

              This post is not complete and I have just jotted down a few points , need to add a lot more points, rephrase the sentences, build a proper website -> switch to aws/digiocean hosting. I need to basically compile these. Make it short and consise. Basically for me to atleast jot it down is one nano step closer to beating my own procrastination.Any stalker who has read uptill here, please just ping me.
